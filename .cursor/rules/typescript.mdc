- Anthias uses TypeScript and React for the front-end framework.
- We use Prettier for formatting and ESLint for linting. Check `README.md` for docs
on how to run them.
- Make sure that generated code conforms to the project's coding standards.
- Reorganize imports to follow the project's coding standards. Order imports
  alphabetically and group imports by type. Imports must be declared in the
  following order:
  - Built-in imports
  - Third-party imports
  - Imports from other files in the project
- Separate import groups with blank lines.
