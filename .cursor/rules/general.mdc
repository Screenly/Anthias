# General

- Anthias uses Django as the web framework

# Project Structure

- [anthias_app](mdc:anthias_app) and [anthias_django](mdc:anthias_django) is where the Django source code lives.
- Django HTML templates live in the [templates](mdc:templates) directory.
- The [static](mdc:static) directory contains static files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  files used for the web interface.
  - The source code was written in CoffeeScript, which gets transpiled to JavaScript.
- The [webpack.common.js](mdc:webpack.common.js), [webpack.dev.js](mdc:webpack.dev.js), and [webpack.prod.js](mdc:webpack.prod.js) are configuration files
  necessary for transpiling CoffeeScript and SCSS source files to JavaScript and CSS files,
  respectively.
- This project uses Docker for containerization.
  - [docker-compose.yml.tmpl](mdc:docker-compose.yml.tmpl) is used for instances installed on Raspberry Pi and x86 devices
    that runs Raspberry Pi OS Lite or Debian.
  - [docker-compose.dev.yml](mdc:docker-compose.dev.yml) is used for Anthias in development mode (e.g., in a laptop or
