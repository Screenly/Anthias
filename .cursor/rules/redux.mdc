# Redux

- Redux is used for state management.
- Use `createSlice` to create new slices.
- Use `createAsyncThunk` to create new async thunks.
- Resort to storing new states in the Redux in cases where you need to share
  data between components that are not directly related.
- Asset-related states (e.g., asset creation, asset update, etc.) must be stored
  in the Redux store.
