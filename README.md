## :sparkles: About Anthias

Anthias is a digital signage platform for Raspberry Pi and x86 devices. Formerly known as Screenly OSE, it was rebranded to clear up the confusion between Screenly (the paid version) and Anthias. More details can be found in [this blog post](https://www.screenly.io/blog/2022/12/06/screenly-ose-now-called-anthias/).

## :white_check_mark: Compatibility

We've tested Anthias and is known to work on the following Raspberry Pi models:

* Raspberry Pi 4 Model B - 32-bt and 64-bit Bullseye, 64-bit Bookworm
* Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ - 32-bit and 64-bit Bullseye, 64-bit Bookworm
* Raspberry Pi 3 Model B - 64-bit Bookworm and Bullseye
* Raspberry Pi 2 Model B - 32-bit Bookworm and Bullseye
* x86 Devices - 64-bit Bookworm
    * These devices can be something similar to a NUC.
