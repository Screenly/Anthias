# Screenly OSE - Digital Signage for the Raspberry Pi

To learn more about Wireload's Screenly, the original project this fork is based on, please visit the official website at [ScreenlyApp.com](http://www.screenlyapp.com). On the official site, you'll find the complete installation instructions.

## This Fork

It was found that the original Screenly missed many useful features including time and pattern based, reoccuring, schedules. These features are being worked on so that a full featured, standalone, digital signage package can be run on the Raspberry Pi for free.
