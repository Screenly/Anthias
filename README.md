# Screenly OSE - Digital Signage for the Raspberry Pi

To learn more about Screenly, please visit the official website at [ScreenlyApp.com](http://www.screenlyapp.com). On the official site, you'll find the complete installation instructions, along with a live-demo of Screenly.

## Dockerized Development Environment

To simplify development of the server module of Screenly OSE, we've created a Docker container. This is intended to run on your local machine with the Screenly OSE repository mounted as a volume.

Assuming you're in the source code repository, simply run:

```
$ docker run --rm -ti \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v $(pwd):/home/pi/screenly \
  wireload/screenly-ose-server
