  ## Usage instructions
  Once your device joins the fleet you'll need to allow some time for it to
  download the application. Screenly’s management URL will appear on your screen 
  (e.g. http://aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd:8080). To manage your content, open up the URL on 
  a different computer. Don’t try to manage the content directly on the Raspberry 
  Pi using a keyboard and mouse. That won’t work.
  
  More guides are available [here](https://support.screenly.io/hc/en-us/sections/360006304773-OSE). 
  If you want to dive deeper into Screenly OSE, you can review the open source code 
  on [Screenly OSE's GitHub](https://github.com/Screenly/screenly-ose).
